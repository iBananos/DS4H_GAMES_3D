# DS4H_GAMES 3D - TRON FEVER - Ralph EL CHALFOUN

Hey, I just created a game for my computer science master’s course.

I just created a game for my computer science master’s course.

Direct link to the game via HEROKU: https://tronfever.herokuapp.com/

Here you will find the development of my 3D game called TronFever inspired by the movie TRON, it is a SNAKE style game, for the moment only the single player mode is available.

Rule of the game :
- Your Tron (motorbike) is moving on its own
- When it walks it creates walls behind it
- Using ‘Q’ & ‘D’ (or the directional arrows ‘LEFT’ & ‘RIGHT’) you can turn left and right
- The ‘SPACE’ key allows JUMP (5 seconds cooldown, 1 second duration)
- The ‘S’ key allows BRAKE (7 seconds cooldown, 3 seconds duration)

PURPOSE: To last the longest in game without hitting a wall or touching the edges of the MAP.

DISCLAIMER:
Currently the game is in development, the displacement calculation is done according to time, the game is not optimized:
  - nor for low configuration PCs,
  - nor for too long a period

(please refresh the page in case of ‘LAG’)

Do not hesitate to give your opinion or / and advice I’m starting on babylon it’s my first try :slight_smile:

Have fun
